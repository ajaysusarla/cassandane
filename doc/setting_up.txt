How To Setup A System To Run Cassandane
---------------------------------------

Cassandane is designed to be operated on a day-to-day basis as an
unprivileged user.  However, Cassandane needs root to make some small
one-time adjustments to be performed to your system before it will run
at all.  This section documents those steps.

1.  Your Cyrus install needs to have this patch applied, which
    allows Cyrus to be started as the Cyrus user instead of being
    started as root and changing to the Cyrus user.

2.  The passwd and group maps need valid entries for user "cyrus"
    and group "mail".  An easy way is to manually add this line
    to /etc/passwd

    cyrus:x:501:8::/usr/cyrus:/bin/sh

    and this line to /etc/group (it's likely already there)

    mail:x:8:

    and then add a password for the "cyrus" user

    # passwd cyrus

3.  You need to be able to run a program as the "cyrus" user, preferably
    without entering your password all the time.  One way of doing this
    is to add the following at the *end* of your /etc/sudoers file

    gnb	ALL = (cyrus) NOPASSWD: ALL

    Obviously, replace 'gnb' with your username.

4.  The pathname /usr/cyrus needs to point to an installed Cyrus.  As
    you will probably want to make changes and re-run tests a lot, the
    easiest thing is to make /usr/cyrus a symlink to a directory you
    can install into.  For example:

    gnb> sudo ln -snf /var/tmp/cassandane-cyrus/usr/cyrus /usr/cyrus
    gnb> cd ~/my/cyrus/workarea
    gnb> make DESTDIR=/var/tmp/cassandane-cyrus install

Now, to run Cassandane use this command

    gnb> cd ~/my/cassandane/workarea
    gnb> sudo -u cyrus ./testrunner.pl -f tap
