How To Setup A System To Run Cassandane
---------------------------------------

Cassandane is designed to be operated on a day-to-day basis as an
unprivileged user.  However, Cassandane needs root to make some small
one-time adjustments to be performed to your system before it will run
at all.  This section documents those steps.

0.  Before doing anything else, make sure you have all the pre-reqs
    listed in README.deps installed.  A good way to check is:

    gnb> cd ~/my/cassandane/workarea
    gnb> make
    ...
    testrunner.pl syntax OK
    Cassandane/ThreadedGenerator.pm syntax OK
    Cassandane/MasterEvent.pm syntax OK
    Cassandane/PortManager.pm syntax OK
    Cassandane/IMAPMessageStore.pm syntax OK
    ...

1.  Your Cyrus install needs to have this patch applied, which
    allows Cyrus to be started as the Cyrus user instead of being
    started as root and changing to the Cyrus user.

    http://git.cyrusimap.org/cyrus-imapd/commit/?id=a5caf503c7060b4f1ec546e4dc6fe75e5b9c4029

    This patch has been in the CMU master development branch for
    some time, but not in any of the release branches.

2.  The passwd and group maps need valid entries for user "cyrus"
    and group "mail".  An easy way is to manually add this line
    to /etc/passwd

    cyrus:x:501:8::/usr/cyrus:/bin/sh

    and this line to /etc/group (it's likely already there)

    mail:x:8:

    and then add a password for the "cyrus" user

    # passwd cyrus

    NOTE: User 'cyrus' must actually be in 'group' mail, or the annotator
    will fail to start.

3.  You need to be able to run a program as the "cyrus" user, preferably
    without entering your password all the time.  One way of doing this
    is to add the following at the *end* of your /etc/sudoers file

    gnb ALL = (cyrus) NOPASSWD: ALL

    Obviously, replace 'gnb' with your username.

4.  You need to tell Cassandane how to find Cyrus.  There are two
    obvious ways of doing this.

     *  Fully installed Cyrus build in /usr/cyrus.  This requires
        you to do a step as root every time you build Cyrus, which
        can be a pain.

        gnb> cd ~/my/cyrus/workarea
        gnb> ./configure --prefix=/usr/cyrus \
              --with-cyrus-prefix=/usr/cyrus ...
        gnb> make && sudo make install

     *  Partially installed Cyrus build in a temp directory.  This
        is what I use.

        gnb> cd ~/my/cyrus/workarea
        gnb> ./configure --prefix=/usr/cyrus \
              --with-cyrus-prefix=/usr/cyrus ...
        gnb> make && make DESTDIR=/var/tmp/cyrus install

        gnb> cd ~/my/cassandane/workarea
        gnb> cp cassandane.ini.example cassandane.ini
        gnb> vi cassandane.ini
        [cyrus default]
        destdir = /var/tmp/cyrus

    Also note that you can do other combinations too, the trick is to
    set up the 'cyrus default' section in the cassandane.ini such that

     *  'prefix' is the value of --prefix and --cyrus-prefix you used
         when you ran the Cyrus configure script.  Default is /usr/cyrus

     *  'destdir' is the value of DESTDIR when you did 'make install'
        in the Cyrus directory.  Default is empty.

5.  It's also a good idea to set some kernel tunables.

    When dumping core files, use the PID of the dumping process
    in the name, so that if multiple processes dump core during the
    test you'll see all the core files instead of just one named "core".

    # echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid

    As a security feature, Linux won't generate cores for processes
    which have changed ownership.  This prevents any of the Cyrus
    processes in your test ever dumping core, so you want to turn
    that feature off.

    # echo 1 >/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable

    Finally, some Linux systems might require to unlimit the size of
    core dumps. As suid_dumpable, this shouldn't normally be set on
    production systems.

    # ulimit -c unlimited

Now, to run Cassandane use this command

    gnb> cd ~/my/cassandane/workarea
    gnb> ./testrunner.pl -f tap

    NOTE: Cassandane will internally run 'sudo' to become user 'cyrus'
