This document describes how to run the Cassandane tests.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before running any Cassandane tests, you need to have the following:

 * A Cyrus installation, such as an installed package, installed
   under /usr/cyrus/.  Currently only the bin/ subdirectory is
   needed.

 * A user "cyrus" in the system password database (e.g. /etc/passwd).
   Most Cyrus packages will ensure this exists as a side effect
   of installation.

 * The various pieces of Perl software mentioned in README.deps
   installed where they available to Perl (e.g. in a directory
   mentioned in $PERL5LIB).

Running Tests
-------------

Cassandane tests are run out of the Cassandane directory itself, without
installing Cassandane anywhere.  This is not the result of deliberate policy so
much as implementation laziness.

All runtime state is created under the directory /var/tmp/cass/, and
results reports are written to the current working directory.  Apart from
reports, Cassandane does not require write permission to its source directory.

Cassandane (or more precisely, the Cyrus code it exercises) needs to be run
either as the superuser or as the "cyrus" user.  If run as another user,
it attempts to use 'sudo' to re-run itself as the "cyrus" user.

The script 'testrunner.pl' is your interface for running Cassandane tests.
There are several other Perl scripts in the directory, but they are utilities
which were helpful during manual testing rather than part of the test suite
itself.

With no arguments, testrunner.pl runs all the tests that come with Cassandane
and reports the results in the jUnit test report format.  The testrunner.pl
exit code will be 0 if all tests passed, non-zero otherwise.


root@testbox# ls reports
ls: cannot access reports: No such file or directory

root@testbox# ./testrunner.pl

root@testbox# ls reports
TEST-Cassandane.Cyrus.Conversations.xml  TEST-Cassandane.Test.DateTime.xml
TEST-Cassandane.Cyrus.Replication.xml	 TEST-Cassandane.Test.Instance.xml
TEST-Cassandane.Cyrus.Simple.xml	 TEST-Cassandane.Test.Message.xml
TEST-Cassandane.Test.Address.xml	 TEST-Cassandane.Test.MessageStoreFactory.xml
TEST-Cassandane.Test.Config.xml


The jUnit format is the default because it's widely used and in particular it's
compatible with the Jenkins Continuous Integration server.  The reports will be
available in the directory reports/ and will be named TEST-Cassandane.*.xml,
one XML file for each group of tests.

Conveniently, the first line of each XML report will contain a count of the
number of test failures in the corresponding group, so you can use "head" to
discover if anything went wrong.

root@testbox# head -1 reports/TEST*.xml

==> reports/TEST-Cassandane.Cyrus.Conversations.xml <==
<testsuite failures="0"

==> reports/TEST-Cassandane.Cyrus.Simple.xml <==
<testsuite failures="0"

==> reports/TEST-Cassandane.Test.Address.xml <==
<testsuite failures="0"

==> reports/TEST-Cassandane.Test.Config.xml <==
<testsuite failures="0"

==> reports/TEST-Cassandane.Test.CyrusInstance.xml <==
<testsuite failures="0"

==> reports/TEST-Cassandane.Test.DateTime.xml <==
<testsuite failures="0"

==> reports/TEST-Cassandane.Test.MessageStoreFactory.xml <==
<testsuite failures="0"

==> reports/TEST-Cassandane.Test.Message.xml <==
<testsuite failures="0"

More useful for manual running is the TAP output format, which is designed for
automated use but is also more human friendly.  TAP is a common format which
originated with Perl and is now widely used, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol for more information. The
TAP format can be selected by using the "-f tap" option to testrunner.pl.


root@testbox# ./testrunner.pl -f tap
....
Time:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)

OK (4 tests)
..
Time:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)

OK (2 tests)
.
Time:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.01 sys =  0.01 CPU)

OK (1 tests)
...........
Time:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)

OK (11 tests)
....
Time:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)

OK (4 tests)
.
Time:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.01 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.01 CPU)

OK (1 tests)


You can run only a subset of tests by giving an argument to testrunner.pl.
The argument can be

 * a group of tests (which maps to a directory in Cassandane)

    me@testbox% ./testrunner.pl Cassandane::Cyrus

 * a test suite (which maps to a module in Cassandane)

    me@testbox% ./testrunner.pl Cassandane::Cyrus::Quota

 * a test suite without the leading Cassandane::Cyrus

    me@testbox% ./testrunner.pl Quota

 * a single test in a single test suite

    me@testbox% ./testrunner.pl Quota.quotarename

Arguments can be negated by using a leading exclamation mark (!)
character, e.g.

    me@testbox% ./testrunner.pl \!Quota

will run all the tests from all the suites except the Quota suite.
Arguments accumulate from left to right, so e.g.

    me@testbox% ./testrunner.pl Quota \!Quota.quotarename

will run all the tests in the Quota suite except the quoterename test.

The -v (or --verbose) option to testrunner.pl causes both Cassandane and
several Cyrus programs run by Cassandane, to emit a lot of information
to stderr.  The output from Cassandane is prefixed by "=====>".

The --valgrind option to testrunner.pl runs all the Cyrus executables
using Valgrind.  This is of course much slower but is recommended
because it finds many subtle bugs.  The Valgrind logs are saved in
the files /var/tmp/cass/$instance/vglogs/$name.$pid.  Cassandane does
not examine these logs in any way; in particular it will not fail if
Valgrind detects any errors.
